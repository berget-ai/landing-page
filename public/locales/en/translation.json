      "description": "We realised that many organisations are held back in their pursuit of AI by a range of obstacles. Some struggle with legal and regulatory challenges, others simply don’t have the skills or capital to train, host and serve their own AI models. Many are reluctant to invest upfront in GPUs or lack access to local language-capable large language models. That’s why we built Berget AI – to unlock the full potential of AI for innovation and growth by championing sovereign, open and sustainable AI.",
