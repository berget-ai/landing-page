# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

> Our Service Level Agreement guarantees enterprise-grade reliability for your AI infrastructure. We commit to 99.9% monthly uptime, backed by automatic service credits. Features include: transparent uptime calculations, generous compensation for any service disruptions, and clear incident reporting procedures. Perfect for businesses that need dependable AI infrastructure with strong reliability guarantees.

## 1. Overview
This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") is part of your agreement with Berget AI for the use of our AI infrastructure and services. It describes the levels of service you should expect from us and defines our mutual responsibilities.

## 2. Service Commitment
Berget AI will use commercially reasonable efforts to make our services available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.9% during any monthly billing cycle (the "Service Commitment").

## 3. Definitions

- **Monthly Uptime Percentage** is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes during the month in which our services were in the state of "Unavailable."
- **Unavailable** means that all connection requests to the service fail during a one-minute period.

## Service Credits

If we fail to meet the Service Commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit according to the following table:

| Monthly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit Percentage |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Less than 99.9% but ≥ 99.0% | 10% |
| Less than 99.0% but ≥ 95.0% | 25% |
| Less than 95.0% | 100% |

## Exclusions

The Service Commitment does not apply to any unavailability, suspension, or termination of services that:
1. Results from a suspension of your account
2. Is caused by factors outside of our reasonable control
3. Results from any actions or inactions by you or any third party
4. Results from your equipment, software, or other technology

## Credit Request and Payment Procedures

To receive a Service Credit, you must submit a claim by sending an email to support@berget.ai. To be eligible, we must receive the credit request within 30 days of the incident.

## Changes to SLA

We reserve the right to change this SLA at any time, though we will provide at least 30 days notice for any material changes.
