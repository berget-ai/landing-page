## Visual Elements

### Background Effects

#### Grid Pattern
A subtle grid pattern (24px Ã— 24px) with thin white lines (opacity 0.02) adds texture and depth to backgrounds without being distracting.

#### Bokeh Effect
Soft, blurred circular elements that float in the background create an atmospheric, technical feel. These should be used sparingly and with low opacity (0.15-0.3).

#### Network Visualization
Animated network visualizations with nodes and connecting lines represent AI connections and data flow. These should be subtle and not interfere with content readability.

### UI Components

#### Cards
- Rounded corners (border-radius: 0.75rem)
- Subtle border (border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1))
- Slight backdrop blur (backdrop-filter: blur(16px))
- Optional hover effects: slight elevation, border brightening

#### Buttons
- Rounded shape (border-radius: 0.75rem)
- Clear hierarchy between primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons
- Consistent padding (0.75rem 1.5rem)
- Subtle hover and active states

### Iconography

We use Lucide icons throughout our interface for their clean, consistent style.

- **Icon Sizes**: 
  - Small: 16px (text-level icons)
  - Medium: 20px (button icons, UI elements)
  - Large: 24px (feature icons, navigation)
  - Extra Large: 32px+ (hero sections, feature highlights)

- **Icon Style**:
  - Stroke width: 1.5px (consistent across all icons)
  - Rounded caps and joins
  - Consistent padding within containers

## Photography & Imagery

## Animation Guidelines

### Principles
- Subtle and purposeful (never animate for animation's sake)

- Smooth easing functions (cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1))

### Timing
- Fast interactions: 150-200ms
- Standard transitions: 200-300ms

### Writing Guidelines

## Accessibility

All design elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards:
- Maintain minimum contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Ensure all interactive elements have clear focus states
- Never use color alone to convey meaning
- Design with screen readers and assistive technologies in mind
