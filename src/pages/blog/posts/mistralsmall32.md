New model drop! Mistral released 3.2 end of June and we have upgrded the 3.1 version to the latest 3.2.

We try to be fast and are now offering and we really like this small and capable workhorse.

The Mistral Small 3.1 end-point now points to the new Mistral 3.2 model for easy transition.

Try it out in our APIs!
