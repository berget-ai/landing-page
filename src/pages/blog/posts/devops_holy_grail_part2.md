_Building on Part 1's foundation, let's add automatic HTTPS and DNS management - the security and reliability features that separate hobby projects from production systems - Part 2_

---

In [Part 1](/blog/devops_holy_grail_part1), we built the foundation: containerization, CI/CD, Kubernetes basics, and GitOps with FluxCD. Now it's time to add the security and reliability features that make your system production-ready.

This isn't just about checking security boxes. It's about building systems that users trust and that scale without breaking.

## Why HTTPS Matters: More Than Just a Green Lock

HTTPS isn't optional anymore. It's the foundation of web security, and here's why it matters more than ever:

### The Security Imperative

**Data Protection**: Every request without HTTPS is visible to anyone between your user and your server. Passwords, API keys, personal dataâ€”all transmitted in plain text over HTTP.

**Authentication**: HTTPS proves your server is actually your server, not an imposter. Without it, users have no way to know they're talking to the real you.

**Integrity**: HTTPS ensures data isn't modified in transit. Without it, attackers can inject malicious code into your pages.

### The Business Impact

**SEO Rankings**: Google penalizes HTTP sites in search results. HTTPS is a ranking factor.

**Browser Warnings**: Modern browsers show scary warnings for HTTP sites, especially those with forms. Users abandon sites with security warnings.

**API Requirements**: Most modern APIs require HTTPS. Payment processors, social logins, and third-party services won't work over HTTP.

**Compliance**: GDPR, PCI DSS, and other regulations often require encrypted data transmission.

## A Brief History of TLS: From Netscape to Let's Encrypt

Understanding where HTTPS came from helps appreciate why automation matters:

### The Early Days (1994-2000)

**SSL 1.0** (1994): Netscape's first attempt. Never released due to security flaws.

**SSL 2.0** (1995): First public version. Quickly found to have major vulnerabilities.

**SSL 3.0** (1996): More secure, but still had issues. Became the foundation for TLS.

### The TLS Era (1999-Present)

**TLS 1.0** (1999): The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) took over from Netscape, creating Transport Layer Security.

**TLS 1.1** (2006): Fixed vulnerabilities in TLS 1.0.

**TLS 1.2** (2008): Major security improvements. Still widely used today.

**TLS 1.3** (2018): Faster, more secure. Removes legacy cryptography.

### The Certificate Authority Problem

For decades, getting HTTPS certificates was:
- **Expensive**: $100-500+ per year per domain
- **Complex**: Manual processes, CSR generation, validation emails
- **Fragile**: Manual renewal every 1-2 years, easy to forget
- **Exclusive**: Only big companies could afford certificates for all their domains

This created a two-tier internet: secure sites for those who could afford it, insecure sites for everyone else.

### The Let's Encrypt Revolution (2016)

Let's Encrypt changed everything:
- **Free**: No cost for certificates
- **Automated**: API-driven certificate issuance and renewal
- **Open**: Transparent, auditable processes
- **Universal**: Anyone can get certificates

**The Impact**: HTTPS adoption went from ~40% to ~95% of web traffic in just a few years.

## Automatic HTTPS with cert-manager: Set It and Forget It

cert-manager brings Let's Encrypt automation to Kubernetes. Install it once, and never think about certificates again.

<LLMPrompt title="ðŸ¤– cert-manager Setup with Let's Encrypt">
Set up cert-manager in my Kubernetes cluster for automatic HTTPS certificates. I need:
- Complete cert-manager installation via Helm/Flux
- ClusterIssuer configuration for Let's Encrypt production certificates
- Updated Ingress manifests with TLS annotations for automatic certificate generation
- Explanation of how cert-manager automatically renews certificates
- Troubleshooting commands to check certificate status
- Support for multiple domains and wildcard certificates
- Integration with existing GitOps workflow

My email is admin@example.com and I want certificates for myapp.example.com and *.myapp.example.com
</LLMPrompt>

### Installing cert-manager

```yaml
# k8s/cert-manager-namespace.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: cert-manager
---
# k8s/cert-manager-helm-repo.yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: jetstack
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  interval: 1h
  url: https://charts.jetstack.io
---
# k8s/cert-manager.yaml
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: cert-manager
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  interval: 30m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: cert-manager
      version: '1.13.x'
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: jetstack
        namespace: cert-manager
  values:
    installCRDs: true
    global:
      leaderElection:
        namespace: cert-manager
```

### Creating a Certificate Issuer

```yaml
# k8s/cluster-issuer.yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    # Let's Encrypt production server
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: admin@example.com
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    solvers:
      # HTTP-01 challenge for regular domains
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: nginx
      # DNS-01 challenge for wildcard certificates
      - dns01:
          cloudflare:
            email: admin@example.com
            apiTokenSecretRef:
              name: cloudflare-api-token
              key: api-token
        selector:
          dnsNames:
            - "*.example.com"
```

### Using Certificates in Ingress

```yaml
# k8s/ingress.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-app
  annotations:
    # Tell cert-manager to create a certificate
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    # Force HTTPS redirects
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - myapp.example.com
        - api.myapp.example.com
      secretName: myapp-tls  # cert-manager creates this automatically
  rules:
    - host: myapp.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-app
                port:
                  number: 80
```

### How Automatic Renewal Works

cert-manager handles the entire certificate lifecycle:

1. **Issuance**: When you create an Ingress with cert-manager annotations, it automatically requests certificates from Let's Encrypt
2. **Validation**: cert-manager proves you control the domain using HTTP-01 or DNS-01 challenges
3. **Storage**: Certificates are stored as Kubernetes Secrets
4. **Renewal**: cert-manager automatically renews certificates 30 days before expiration
5. **Updates**: New certificates are automatically deployed to your Ingress controllers

**You never touch certificates manually again.**

### Monitoring Certificate Health

```yaml
# k8s/certificate-monitoring.yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: certificate-alerts
spec:
  groups:
    - name: certificates
      rules:
        - alert: CertificateExpiringSoon
          expr: certmanager_certificate_expiration_timestamp_seconds - time() < 7 * 24 * 3600
          for: 1h
          annotations:
            summary: "Certificate expiring soon"
            description: "Certificate {{ $labels.name }} expires in less than 7 days"
        
        - alert: CertificateNotReady
          expr: certmanager_certificate_ready_status == 0
          for: 10m
          annotations:
            summary: "Certificate not ready"
            description: "Certificate {{ $labels.name }} is not ready"
```

## DNS Automation: Why Manual DNS is a Liability

Managing DNS records manually doesn't scale. Here's why automation matters:

### The Manual DNS Problem

**Human Error**: Typos in DNS records cause outages. A missing dot, wrong IP, or incorrect TTL can break everything.

**Slow Changes**: Manual DNS updates take time. In incident response, every minute matters.

**Inconsistency**: Different team members make changes differently. No standard process leads to configuration drift.

**No Audit Trail**: Who changed what DNS record when? Manual changes are hard to track.

**Scaling Issues**: Adding new services means updating DNS records. This doesn't scale with microservices.

### The Business Case for DNS Automation

**Faster Deployments**: New services get DNS records automatically. No waiting for ops team.

**Reduced Outages**: Automated DNS reduces human error, the leading cause of outages.

**Better Security**: Automated DNS can implement security policies consistently.

**Cost Savings**: Less manual work means lower operational costs.

## Automatic DNS with external-dns

external-dns watches your Kubernetes Ingress and Service resources and automatically creates DNS records.

<LLMPrompt title="ðŸ¤– external-dns Setup for Automatic DNS Management">
Set up external-dns for automatic DNS management in my Kubernetes cluster. I need:
- Complete external-dns installation via Helm/Flux
- Configuration for Cloudflare DNS provider (include other popular providers as options)
- Required API token setup and secret creation
- Ingress annotations for automatic DNS record creation
- Examples for different DNS providers (Route53, Google DNS, etc.)
- Troubleshooting steps to verify DNS automation is working
- Integration with existing GitOps workflow

I'm using Cloudflare as my DNS provider and want DNS records created automatically when I add ingress rules.
</LLMPrompt>

### Installing external-dns

```yaml
# k8s/external-dns-namespace.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: external-dns
---
# k8s/external-dns-helm-repo.yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: external-dns
  namespace: external-dns
spec:
  interval: 1h
  url: https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/
---
# k8s/external-dns.yaml
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: external-dns
  namespace: external-dns
spec:
  interval: 30m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: external-dns
      version: '1.14.x'
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: external-dns
        namespace: external-dns
  values:
    provider: cloudflare
    env:
      - name: CF_API_TOKEN
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: cloudflare-api-token
            key: api-token
    txtOwnerId: "my-cluster"
    policy: sync  # or 'upsert-only' for safer operation
    sources:
      - ingress
      - service
    domainFilters:
      - example.com  # Only manage records for this domain
```

### Creating DNS Provider Secrets

```yaml
# k8s/cloudflare-secret.yaml (encrypted with sealed-secrets)
apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
kind: SealedSecret
metadata:
  name: cloudflare-api-token
  namespace: external-dns
spec:
  encryptedData:
    api-token: AgBy3i4OJSWK+PiTySYZZA9rO43cGDEQAx...
  template:
    metadata:
      name: cloudflare-api-token
      namespace: external-dns
```

### Using DNS Automation in Ingress

```yaml
# k8s/ingress-with-dns.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-app
  annotations:
    # cert-manager creates certificates
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    # external-dns creates DNS records
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: myapp.example.com,api.myapp.example.com
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl: "300"
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - myapp.example.com
        - api.myapp.example.com
      secretName: myapp-tls
  rules:
    - host: myapp.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-app
                port:
                  number: 80
    - host: api.myapp.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-api
                port:
                  number: 80
```

### Multi-Provider DNS Setup

external-dns supports multiple DNS providers:

```yaml
# For AWS Route53
values:
  provider: aws
  aws:
    region: us-west-2
    zoneType: public
  serviceAccount:
    annotations:
      eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/external-dns

# For Google Cloud DNS
values:
  provider: google
  google:
    project: my-project
    serviceAccountSecret: google-service-account

# For Azure DNS
values:
  provider: azure
  azure:
    resourceGroup: my-resource-group
    tenantId: my-tenant-id
    subscriptionId: my-subscription-id
```

## The Complete Automation Stack

When you combine cert-manager and external-dns, deploying a new service becomes trivial:

```yaml
# k8s/new-service.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: new-service
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: new-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: new-service
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: my-org/new-service:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: new-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: new-service
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: new-service
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: new.example.com
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - new.example.com
      secretName: new-service-tls
  rules:
    - host: new.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: new-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

**Commit this to Git, and within minutes you have:**
- A running service
- Automatic DNS record creation
- Automatic HTTPS certificate
- Automatic certificate renewal

## Security Best Practices

### Certificate Security

**Use Production Let's Encrypt**: The staging server has rate limits but issues untrusted certificates. Only use it for testing.

**Monitor Certificate Health**: Set up alerts for certificate expiration and renewal failures.

**Secure Private Keys**: cert-manager stores private keys in Kubernetes Secrets. Ensure your cluster has proper RBAC.

### DNS Security

**Limit Domain Scope**: Use `domainFilters` to prevent external-dns from managing unintended domains.

**Use Least Privilege**: DNS provider API tokens should have minimal required permissions.

**Monitor DNS Changes**: Set up alerts for unexpected DNS record changes.

**Backup DNS Configuration**: Keep backups of your DNS zone files.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Certificate Problems

```bash
# Check certificate status
kubectl get certificates -A

# Check certificate details
kubectl describe certificate myapp-tls

# Check cert-manager logs
kubectl logs -n cert-manager deployment/cert-manager

# Check certificate challenges
kubectl get challenges -A
```

### DNS Problems

```bash
# Check external-dns logs
kubectl logs -n external-dns deployment/external-dns

# Verify DNS records were created
dig myapp.example.com

# Check external-dns events
kubectl get events -n external-dns
```

## What's Next?

With automatic HTTPS and DNS in place, you now have:

- **Secure communications** with automatic HTTPS certificates
- **Reliable DNS** that updates automatically with your services
- **Zero-maintenance security** through automated certificate renewal
- **Professional appearance** with proper SSL certificates and custom domains

In **[Part 3](/blog/devops_holy_grail_part3)**, we'll add enterprise-grade features:

- **Self-hosted backends** with Supabase
- **Bulletproof secrets management** 
- **Comprehensive monitoring** that prevents incidents
- **Multi-environment deployments**
- **Advanced deployment strategies**
