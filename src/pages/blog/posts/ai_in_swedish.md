# 🇸🇪 Building AI in Swedish? Here’s How to Pick the Right Models — with Help from SEB, EuroEval & Berget AI

Let’s face it: building AI apps in Swedish isn’t always smooth sailing. While the big models dominate in English, **Scandinavian languages often get less love** — which can lead to quirky outputs, underperforming features, and lots of trial and error.

But it doesn’t have to be that way. With the right tools, you can build apps that truly *get* Swedish — and we’re here to show you how.

## 😅 Why Swedish Is Tricky for Language Models

Most LLMs are trained on oceans of English data — but when it comes to Swedish, the waters get a bit shallower. That can lead to:

- Misunderstood context and idioms  
- Lower accuracy in tasks like summarization, Q&A, or classification  
- Head-scratching moments when the model just… doesn’t get it  

So how do you know what model is actually good in Swedish?

## 🚀 Two Great Benchmarks to the Rescue: EuroEval & SEB

### 🧪 EuroEval – General-Purpose Evaluation for Language Models

[**EuroEval**](https://euroeval.com) is a comprehensive evaluation framework that helps you assess **how well language models perform in European languages**, including Swedish. It tests models across a wide range of tasks — from reasoning and comprehension to classification and summarization — giving you a well-rounded view of their capabilities in real-world applications.

Whether you're building chatbots, document understanding tools, or summarization pipelines, EuroEval helps you quickly spot which models are best suited for Swedish-language use cases.

### 🔍 SEB – Focused on Embedding Models for Scandinavian Languages

[**Scandinavian Embedding Benchmark (SEB)**](https://kennethenevoldsen.github.io/scandinavian-embedding-benchmark) is tailored for evaluating **embedding models** across Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. It focuses on tasks like semantic similarity, clustering, and reranking — the kind of stuff you rely on for search, recommendation, and retrieval-based applications.

SEB offers a detailed leaderboard that makes it easy to see which embedding models really “get” the nuances of Scandinavian languages.

**In short:**
- 🧠 Use **EuroEval** to benchmark language understanding and generation.
- 🧭 Use **SEB** to evaluate embeddings for search and semantic tasks.
