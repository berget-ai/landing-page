Hi again!

We hope that you are enjoying summer, or at least soon will be. At Berget AI we are still hard at work to ship new features, trim model serving performance, prepare new product launches and preparing a better sign-up flow. Since last update, we have had a continued inflow of leads and customers and are seing the need for sovereign AI services remain on a strong upward slope.

**Strong interest in Speech models**

A continued momentum in the speech-to-text and text-to-speech is clearly visible in the market, and we feel it too. We launched KB Whisper a while back and recently upgraded the serving back-end for improved performance and now deliver

* KBWhisper Large for serverless inference
* 10x real-time transcription speed - 60min audio files transcribed in 6 minutes

TTS and STT remains an area we are very excited about and we will continue to develop our model and API services in this space. If anyone knows about an open STT model capable of Swedish - please let us know!

**Model line up**

Now our model set is stabilizing in line with our ambition to provide a more stable API set for customers to develop towards - the workhorse models in our lineup are Llama 3.3.70B and Mistral Small 3.2. Our model setup is now

* (NEW) Mistral Small 3.2 24B (2506) - updated to the June release - available also on the old end-point
* (NEW) Devstral Small 1.1 (2507) - a very capable open model for software engineering tasks - replaces DeepCoder 14B
* (NEW) KBWhisper Large - the best performing Speech-to-Text model for the Swedish language
* (NEW) Magistral Small (2506) - a fast and capable reasoning model from Mistral
* DeepSeek R1 MAI DS
* Qwen 3 32B
* Llama 3.3 70B Instruct
* Llama 3.1 8B
* BGE Reranker v2-m3 on our reranker end-point
* Multilingual E5 Large Instruct on our embeddings endpoint
* Do you have any models or variants you would like to see on the list?

**Buildling our customer and partner ecosystem**

We are happy to see that Berget AI is becoming a trusted partner to builders of AI solutions. We recently announced our partnership with **Algorithma** where Berget AI will enable hosting of AI agents for use cases with high data security demands. We have a number of other partnerships brewing - to be announced at a later date. Do you want to become our partner? Let us know!

We are also happy to welcome **Demoskop** to the list of customers!

> "We’re already testing several of our most used AI applications in the Berget Cloud environment. So far, the results are extremely 
> promising. This marks an important step for us, not only technically but also strategically. For me personally, investing in Swedish 
> innovation and choosing European-built infrastructure isn’t about politics. It’s about long-term responsibility, independence, and trust
> Looking forward to seeing where this partnership takes us.​"

**What is next**

We are continuing to build on our service line-up - both inference API as well as working towards launching our kubernetes compute service where you can develop and host your agentic applications  - please let us know if you want to try it out already now!

**_Until next time and enjoy the summer!_**
