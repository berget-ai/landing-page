_The complete guide to creating services that grow from weekend projects to enterprise platforms without breaking everything_

This comprehensive guide has been split into two focused parts for better readability:

## Part 1: From Zero to Production

## Why Split This Guide?

We've learned that most teams need to implement these patterns incrementally. Part 1 gets you to production quickly with a solid foundation. Part 2 adds the enterprise features you'll need as you grow.

Both parts work together to create infrastructure that starts simple but scales infinitelyâ€”the true DevOps holy grail.

**Start with Part 1** if you're building something new or want to modernize your deployment pipeline.

**Jump to Part 2** if you already have basic CI/CD and want to add enterprise-grade features.
