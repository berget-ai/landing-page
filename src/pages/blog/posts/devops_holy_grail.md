_The complete guide to creating services that grow from weekend projects to enterprise platforms without breaking everything_

---

This comprehensive guide has been split into two focused parts for better readability:

## Part 1: From Zero to Production

**[Read Part 1: The DevOps Holy Grail - From Zero to Production](/blog/devops_holy_grail_part1)**

Learn the fundamentals:

- Containerization and CI/CD setup
- Kubernetes basics that actually work
- GitOps with FluxCD
- Basic auto-scaling

Perfect for getting your first deployment running quickly.

## Part 2: HTTPS and DNS Automation

**[Read Part 2: The DevOps Holy Grail - HTTPS and DNS Automation](/blog/devops_holy_grail_part2)**

Add security and reliability:

- Why HTTPS matters and the history of TLS
- Automatic HTTPS certificates with cert-manager
- DNS automation with external-dns
- Security best practices and monitoring

Everything you need to make your system production-ready and secure.

## Part 3: Enterprise-Grade Features

**[Read Part 3: The DevOps Holy Grail - Enterprise-Grade Features](/blog/devops_holy_grail_part3)**

Add advanced capabilities:

- Self-hosted Supabase backend
- Bulletproof secrets management (see our [dedicated guide](/blog/kubernetes_secrets_management))
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Multi-environment deployments
- Migration strategies and advanced patterns

Everything you need to scale from startup to enterprise.

## Why Split This Guide?

We've learned that most teams need to implement these patterns incrementally:

- **Part 1** gets you to basic production quickly with containerization, CI/CD, and GitOps
- **Part 2** adds the security and reliability features that make your system production-ready
- **Part 3** adds the enterprise features you'll need as you scale

All three parts work together to create infrastructure that starts simple but scales infinitelyâ€”the true DevOps holy grail.

**Start with Part 1** if you're building something new or want to modernize your deployment pipeline.

**Move to Part 2** when you need proper HTTPS and DNS automation.

**Add Part 3** when you need enterprise-grade features like monitoring and advanced deployments.
